# Diabetes mellitus Predictive Modelling
Profiles of healthy people and diabetic people were analyzed and used to build a predictive model to gauge the diabetes risk index of an untested person.
## How to Run
Download the file and run on Jupyter Notebook on Anaconda 3.

At the end of the file, you'll be required to enter your health indicators, such as your BMI, Blood Glucose levels, Age, etc. The predictive model will return a Diabetes Risk Index and give a short health recommendation based on that.
